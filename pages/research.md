**Abstract**<br>
Deception is a complex social skill present in human interactions. Many social professions such as teachers, therapists and law enforcement officers leverage on deception detection techniques to support their work activities. Robots with the ability to autonomously detect deception could provide an important aid to human-human and human-robot interactions. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the possibility to develop a lie detection system that could be implemented on robots. To this goal, we focus on human and human robot interaction to understand if there is a difference in the behavior of the participants when lying to a robot or to a human. Participants were shown short movies of robberies and then interrogated by a human and by a humanoid robot “detectives.” According to the instructions, subjects provided veridical responses to half of the question and false replies to the other half. Behavioral variables such as eye movements, time to respond and eloquence were measured during the task, while personality traits were assessed before experiment initiation. Participant's behavior showed strong similarities during the interaction with the human and the humanoid. Moreover, the behavioral features were used to train and test a lie detection algorithm. The results show that the selected behavioral variables are valid markers of deception both in human-human and in human-robot interactions and could be exploited to effectively enable robots to detect lies.

**Abstract**<br>
Detecting lies in real world scenarios is a necessary skill for a humanoid robot that aims to act as a teacher, therapist or caregiver. In these contexts, it is important to be able to detect increases in cognitive load (e.g. due to lie fabrication) while preserving the pleasantness of the social interaction, the informality of the relation and without the need of a strict interrogatory-like scenario. This study investigates whether behavioral cues related to lie detection – like pupil dilation associated to an increase in cognitive load – can be exploited by a robot in order to identify a lie in a fast and minimally invasive scenario. The iCub humanoid robot plays the role of a magician in a card game, telling which card the human partner is lying about. The results show a greater pupil dilation in presence of a false statement with respect to a truthful description. A heuristic method is proposed to identify the falsely described card, reaching an accuracy of 71.4% (against a chance level of 16.6%). The study also proposes the implementation of a random forest binary classifier that can detect lies with precision and recall of 83.3%. Finally, the current work suggests a potential assessment of the lying strategy of the interacting partner, equipping the humanoid robot of a set of tools to detect lies in real world settings.
