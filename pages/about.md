# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology. My research focuses on two exciting areas. First, I leverage **Cognitive Architectures and Deep Learning** to empower the humanoid robot iCub with embodied and personalized **Artificial Cognition**. This involves enabling the robot to autonomously learn from everyday first-person experiences, with the goal of developing advanced social robots that can adapt seamlessly to the human world. Second, I'm developing **MyCube**, a medical device designed to assess, track, and train **objects manipulation skills in children and adults**. I believe MyCube will significantly enhance our understanding and support of children's well-being, especially those who are neurotypical.

<b>Software Engineering</b> is my primary expertise. I have extensive experience designing and implementing end-to-end architectures that integrate <b>sensors and devices</b> <b>Machine Learning and LLM</b> components, and high-level <b>UX</b> and behaviors. I collaborate daily with teams and mentor younger students, driven by my insatiable curiosity and knack for lateral thinking in problem-solving.

Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about <b>cooking</b> and homebrewing beer—it’s a lot like programming! I also enjoy <b>playing board and card games</b> with friends every week. As a Magic: The Gathering enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for interesting strategies to bring to the table.
