# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Post Doc Researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology. My research is two-folded. On one side, I leverage Cognitive Architectures and Deep Learning to enable the humanoid robot iCub with embodied and personalized **Artificial Cognition**, i.e., the ability to autonomously learn from everyday first-person experiences. I hope this will help the development of better social robot, able to self-adapt to humans' world. On the other side, I'm developing the **MyCUbe** a medical device to assess, track and train the objects manipulation skills of children and adults. I believe the MyCube will greatly help better understand and support children neurotypical children pursuing a better wellbeing.

**Software Engineering** is my main expertise, with extensive experience in the design and implementation of end-to-end architectures, integrating **sensors and devices**, **Machine Learning and LLM components**, and high-level **UX** and behaviors. I daily work in team, mentoring younger students. I'm extremely curious and I always apply lateral thinking to solve problems.

I love **cooking** and homebrewing beer - it's quite like programming!. I weekly **play board and card games** with friends; I'm a Magic the Gathering Nerd, always looking for interesting strategies to bring at the table.
