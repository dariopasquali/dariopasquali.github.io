\cvsection{Projects}

\cvproject{ARIEL (Assessing childRen manIpulation and Exploration skiLls)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop the myCube, a multisensory Medical Device for the assessment and training of manipulation skills in children and adults.
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  
  \cvproject{Embodied AI for Action and Perception (FAIR)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an Artificial Cognition for iCub, enabling the robot to autonomously learn from unsupervised experiences, fostering its ability to adapt and interact dynamically in social and everyday scenarios.
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  
  \cvproject{multipurpose robotics for mAniPulation of defoRmable materIaLs in manufacturing processes (APRIL)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Development of Deep Learning models to assess workers' ergonomic posture, detect falls, and predict collision with objects in real-time in a indurstrial human-robot collaboration setting.
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  
  \cvproject{Lie Detection in Human-Robot Interaction}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Machine Learning model to autonomously detect lies based on a real-time pupillometry-based cognitive load evaluation. Implemented on the humanoid robot iCub and tested both in a lab and in real-environments (Maker Faire Rome 2022) leveraging interactive online learning.
    \end{itemize}
    \smallskip
  
  \cvproject{Proactive Memory iN AI for Development (PROMEN-AID)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Enable the RB-KAIROS+ robot to adapt its behavior thanks to with a biological-inspired working memory, ensuring workers' safety in an industrial scenario.
    \end{itemize}
