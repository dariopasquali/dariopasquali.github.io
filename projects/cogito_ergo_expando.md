Group project for the Artificial Intelligence course in collaboration with [Federico Ruggeri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-ruggeri-a87647145/) e [Sara Bevilaqua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-bevilacqua-00319113a/).

We developed a AI bot for ine man's morris boardgame for a University competition. We implemented a revised version of the Petcu-Holban heuristic function that takes into consideration the opponent possible movements. The pruning is based on Negamax algorithm and exploits a trasnposition table to speed-up the search.
