# Artificial Cognition, From the Ground Up!

This project aims at enabling the humanoid robot iCub to collect and learn from unsupervised first-hand experiences autonomously. Such **personal, situated, embodied, and developmental-inspired Artificial Cognition** will be crucial to enable social robots to dynamically adapt and interact in everyday life scenarios.
