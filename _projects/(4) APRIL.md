# multipurpose robotics for mAniPulation of defoRmable materIaLs in manufacturing processes (APRIL)

The APRIL project (multipurpose robotics for mAniPulation of defoRmable materIaLs in manufacturing processes) is developing autonomous, dexterous and market-oriented robot prototypes to innovate the manufacturing of flexible and deformable materials in European enterprises.

As IIT, we took care of sensing and tracking human collaborations' erogomics and safety. We developed modules to evaluate in real-time how much the humans' posture was ergonomic, to detect workers falling on the ground, and to predit hits with moving objects and the robotic arm.
