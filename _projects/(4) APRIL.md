# multipurpose robotics for mAniPulation of defoRmable materIaLs in manufacturing processes (APRIL)

The APRIL project (multipurpose robotics for mAniPulation of defoRmable materIaLs in manufacturing processes) is developing autonomous, dexterous and market-oriented robot prototypes to innovate the manufacturing of flexible and deformable materials in European enterprises.

I took care of sensing and tracking human collaborations' erogomics and safety. We developed modules to evaluate in real-time how much the humans' posture was ergonomic, to detect workers falling on the ground, and to predit hits with moving objects and the robotic arm.
